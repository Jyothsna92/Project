Make a small rails project which can collect public information like Name, Address(Address, city, state, country pincode), phone number, email, activities he performs.  Form should accept only valid entries. Once any entry is added, it should be displayed in the list. You can have add, edit, delete along side the list. In the list you can rearrange the order of person by drag and drop on webpage. 

Rearrange means: For example you have list of 10 people displayed in order of a, b, c, d, e, fâ€¦..and so on. I can drag d to the first position. When next time I open the page, it should be on first position only.  

List should be displayed in a nice format. CSS should be used properly and appropriately. 

A person can have many pets e.g Cats, Dogs. I should be able to make a list of pets he has.  Can add, edit, delete. You can put a button in the people list to view his/her pets.
